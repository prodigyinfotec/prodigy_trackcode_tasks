#Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

#CODE
Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset (replace 'Mall_Customers.csv' with the actual file path)
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_downloaded_folder/Mall_Customers.csv')

# Select relevant features for clustering (e.g., 'Annual Income' and 'Spending Score')
X = data[['Annual Income (k$)', 'Spending Score (1-100)']]

# Choose the number of clusters (you can adjust this based on your analysis)
num_clusters = 5

# Create and fit the K-means model
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, random_state=42)
data['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

# Visualize the clusters
plt.scatter(X['Annual Income (k$)'], X['Spending Score (1-100)'], c=data['Cluster'], cmap='rainbow')
plt.xlabel('Annual Income (k$)')
plt.ylabel('Spending Score (1-100)')
plt.title('K-means Clustering of Customers')
plt.show()
